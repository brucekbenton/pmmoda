Model Based Estimation Tool application

This code represents a Model BAsed Estimation project implemented by me. The application is a thin client UI implemented primarily in JavaScript, 
WebAPI (Controller and Models) implemented in C# and hosted on an IIS web server and the DDL scripts for the SQL server tables and procedures. 
Currently, this project does not include creation scripts for the database itself so that has to be created manually
