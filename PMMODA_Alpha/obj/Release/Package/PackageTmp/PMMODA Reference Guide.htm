    <h1>1 Security</h1>

    <p>PMMODA is a multi-tenanted system with multiple companies sharing the same database. In order to full protect the confidentiality of information stored in this system security is enforced on both the client and the server side. All data filtering is performed on the server to ensure that no protected information is ever sent across the network. Every server requests are completely authenticated on the server side to ensure that data is filtered at the record level prior to returning data to the client. Additionally, all communications with the server are done via HTTPS to protect against network monitoring tools (Note: This feature will be enabled prior to product release).</p>

    <p>In order to simplify the user experience additional filtering is done on the client side to hide features for which the current user does not have permissions. In this case validation requests are made to the server to determine what level of access the user has and the menu and screen content is customized based on the defined access levels. This is completely redundant with the sever filtering and is only performed to simplify the user interface for each user</p>

    <h1>2 User Interface</h1>

    <h2>2.1 Menu</h2>

    <p>Access to application functionality is provided via the menu bar show in Figure 1 below. Most functionality is defined in the sections below but some options are described here.</p>

You will also need to configure each organization to reflect your planned development methodology. </p>

    <p>In PMMODA Organization is a generic concept and does not necessarily map to your traditional organization chart. You may have one functional organization with two, or more, defined PMMODA organizations if they work on more than one business area. Similarly, you may have two functional organizations sharing a single PMMODA organization if they share deliverable responsibilities.</p>

    <p>Activities are used to model your development methodology and help ensure completeness in your project estimates. They typically represent the functional aspect of your process. They can be used to ensure that all roles are represented in your estimates or can be used to separate business aspects such as billable and non-billable effort on a project.</p>

    <p>For a traditional development process the Activities could enumerate role based activities like functional design, implementation, validation, documentation, etc. It may be useful to define Activities even for processes which do not differentiate roles, such as traditional scrum, because it helps the team ensure they are accounting for all aspects of the required work in their estimate. In general Activities have increased value for organizations with less comprehensive effort calibration numbers.</p>

    <p>At least one Activity is required and all organizations are created with a default Activity named “Default”. This Activity should be disabled if you are defining custom Activities for your organization.</p>

    <p>Common values for deliverables might include things like: Web Form, Web Service, Custom Mobile Control, User Document, Business Object, Animation, visual Effect, etc. They will vary significantly by company and business area but should be very consistent across projects in a single organization.</p>

    <p>Projects in PMMODA represent a collection of capabilities to be delivered to the end user. It might represent a complete functional set to be released to customers or incremental functionality that will be included in a future customer release. The structure of your projects will typically reflect your overall development methodology and the size and complexity of the systems you develop. Small internal applications, or agile projects with frequent releases, may be represented as a single project in PMMODA. High complexity enterprise applications or commercial applications with longer release cycles may want to define a project for each milestone or sprint.</p>

    <h2>2.8 Productivity models</h2>

    <p><b>Menu</b>: Productivity Model</p>

    <p>The Productivity Model view provides a summary of the defined Standard Components for the current organization along with the typical effort required to produce a single instance of each unit. Figure 8 shows a representative view of the Standard Components defined for a typical web application. It includes all active Standard Components for the current organization, a description for each unit and the action controls to edit the details on each unit. </p>

    <p>The effort numbers should reflect the numbers of hours required to perform the activity without interruption. The absolute effort associated with each line item in the productivity model will vary based on decisions made in your organization and the scale of the Standard Components chosen for your organization. However, best practice is to ensure that the effort numbers are small enough to assess accurately. Typical ranges for a Standard Component should be from a few hours to a few days. Additionally, note that effort numbers are always generated in units of hours. The primary purpose of this is to ensure that overhead does not get folded into the productivity numbers. Overhead is modeled separately and accounts for time spent on non-project activities.</p>

    <p>Figure 9 shows a sample productivity model for an organization with a single Activity defined. The typical effort for a low complexity, medium complexity and high complexity instances of the current unit. These numbers should be based on historical data from your previous projects. While the data needs to reflect your experience there are general practices that are good to follow. It is usually a good approach to have significant differentiation between the three complexity ratings. Research has shown that people are much better at bucketing items into non-linear buckets than linear buckets. This means that when generating your scope model there will be less ambiguity concerning the appropriate complexity bucket in which to group each deliverable.</p>

    <h2>2.9 Effort Models</h2>

    <p><b>Permissions</b>: Group Member</p>

    <p><b>Menu</b>: Effort Model</p>

    <p>The Effort model view is used to define the work breakdown structure (WBS) for the current project and create the scope model for the defined deliverables. The WBS for the current project should enumerate the customer perceivable capabilities delivered as part of this project. This list will largely be determined by the business domain of the current application and the standard architectural patterns followed in your development process. The view is hierarchical and supports an arbitrary level of detail in the model. The structure of this view should parallel the physical structure of the application and the major components delivered as part of this project. This view of the overall product under development is what enables the organization to perform a comprehensive review of the proposed scope and ensure that the model is complete. This WBS provides a transparent and discoverable outline of all capabilities required to meet customer expectations. The structure enables each team member to perform a detailed review of the application areas where they have significant expertise in order to ensure completeness. Additionally, the documentation of this information in a single accessible location ensures that the entire project team is working under the same set of scope assumptions. </p>

    <p>The scope models defined for each deliverable provide a similar transparent and discoverable view of the effort required to produce each deliverable. Basing these estimates on a productivity model which has been reviewed and approved by the organization ensure a common understanding of the work scope associated with each deliverable. The structure again enables knowledgeable individuals to review each aspect of the project and ensure the complexity assumptions are reasonable based on the documented assumptions.</p>

    <p>Figure 12 shows the primary view of the WBS which is used to track the propose work scope. This view includes the complete list of deliverables, a description for each deliverable, an optional cross reference to a specification or requirements document, the total effort associated with each deliverable and the remaining effort for each deliverable based on the original estimate and the current completeness percentage.</p>

    <p>Figure 14 shows the summary effort graphs provided by PMMODA to quickly assess the remaining effort on the current project. There are two captured views including the Effort by Role and Effort by Standard Component. The Effort by Role view summarizes the remaining project effort categorized by the applicable roles on your project. This is calculated based on the Activities defined for this project and the effort defined in the aggregate scope model. It is intended for the purpose of rationalizing effort demands with resource allocations and enabling your management to understand the staffing requirements for the remainder of the project. The Effort by Standard Component shows the remaining effort categorized by Standard Component and enables an organization to compare project profiles against previous projects and to understand the nature of the remain deliverables on the project.</p>

    <h2>2.10 Timeline</h2>

    <p><b>Permissions</b>: Group Member</p>

    <p><b>Menu</b>: Timeline</p>

    <p>The timeline view shows the range of probably project timelines based on the current effort model, the defined overhead by role, the project staffing model and the documented completion percentage for the current project. This information is available by project. The timelines display represent resource loaded timelines (i.e. they do not account for critical path) determined by calculating the total planned effort and dividing by the available work hours to determine the approximate number of work days it will take to complete the project. There are two views provided including a waterfall, or sequential, model and a concurrent model.</p>

    <p>The waterfall model assumes that all role specific activities are done sequentially (although you cannot define the sequence). This implies all work in a category is completed prior to beginning the next set of activities. This is the most pessimistic view of projected project duration and should represent something close to the upper limit for your project. Note that projects with an unusual high level of task dependencies or a significant set of overloaded critical resources can still exceed this pessimistic projection.</p>

    <p>The concurrent model assumes all activities can be completed in parallel and that there are no dependencies between the work items. This is the most optimistic assumption and will very rarely be true for your project. This will provide the most optimistic estimate for your project.</p>

    <p>Note that you should always create a detailed schedule for your project if you need maximum confidence in your estimates and need to account for critical resources or work item dependencies. These models are provided for the purpose of projecting probable project duration ranges which can be compared to the desired project schedule. This enables you to perform a reality check on project scope and duration prior to performing detailed project scheduling. With this information you can make informed high level business decisions related to scoping, resource investment and project duration earlier in the project lifecycle.</p>
